# META-2.5 Core

> **The Immutable Foundation of WEKAOU**

---

## Overview

META-2.5 Core contains the fundamental primitives of WEKAOU that are:
- **Immutable**: Changes require MAJOR version bump
- **Universal**: Apply across all domains and tiers
- **Foundational**: All other specifications build upon these

---
## Structure

### 00_ontology/
The knowledge representation framework (SPOC-M)

### 01_language/
The Coherent Representation Language (CRL) grammar

### 02_process/
The K-Cycle cognitive process specification

---

## Stability Guarantee

Once this specification reaches STABLE status:
- These primitives become **IMMUTABLE**
- Changes require community consensus + MAJOR version
- Backward compatibility is paramount
- Deprecation requires 2+ year migration period

See [STATUS.md](../STATUS.md) for current status.
