RATIONALE FOR CC BY-SA 4.0 (COPYLEFT)

The WEKAOU® specification uses ShareAlike (copyleft) licensing to ensure:

1. DERIVATIVE STANDARDS REMAIN OPEN
   Any modifications or extensions to WEKAOU must also be open and
   freely available. This prevents proprietary forks that fragment
   the ecosystem.

2. COMMERCIAL USE IS PERMITTED
   Companies can build commercial products using WEKAOU without
   restriction, as long as modifications to the spec remain open.

3. INNOVATION IS ENCOURAGED
   The open nature allows anyone to experiment, improve, and extend
   WEKAOU, contributing back to the commons.

4. INTEROPERABILITY IS PROTECTED
   By preventing closed modifications, we ensure all WEKAOU-based
   systems can interoperate.

This license balances:
- Freedom for implementers (Attribution only for implementations)
- Protection for the standard (ShareAlike for spec derivatives)
- Community sustainability (Open ecosystem, no lock-in)
